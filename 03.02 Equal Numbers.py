#Given three integers, determine how many of them are equal to each other.
#The program must print one of these numbers:
#3 (if all are the same),
#2 (if two of them are equal to each other and the third is different) or
#0 (if all numbers are different).

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
c = int(input("Enter third number: "))


if a==b & b==c:
    print("3")

elif a==b != b==c != a==c:
    print("2")

else:
    print("0")
